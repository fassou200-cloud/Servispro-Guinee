Company login uses RCCM number + password. CompanyDashboard.js has 4 tabs: Profil, Documents, Services, Offres Emploi. Pending companies see restriction messages on Services and Jobs tabs. AdminDashboard.js has Entreprises tab showing company list with details panel including document status and approve/reject/delete buttons. API endpoints: /api/auth/company/register, /api/auth/company/login, /api/company/profile/me, /api/company/upload-document/{type}, /api/admin/companies, /api/admin/companies/{id}/approve, /api/admin/companies/{id}/reject."
